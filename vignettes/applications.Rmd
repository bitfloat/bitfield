# Applications and Citations

This vignette tracks research projects, publications, and real-world applications using the `bitfield` package. As the package adoption grows, this serves as both a showcase of its capabilities and a resource for researchers seeking examples in their domain.

## Academic Publications

### Peer-Reviewed Papers

**Ehrmann, S.** (in preparation). *Exploring bitfields for efficient and reusable metadata processing in earth system science*. Manuscript in preparation for Geoscientific Model Development.

- **Summary**: Introduces the theoretical framework for using bitfields to enable cross-workflow metadata integration in earth system research. Demonstrates a three-project meta-workflow showing how livestock density modeling, ecological carrying capacity assessment, and socioeconomic intervention planning can share rich contextual information through standardized bitfield encoding.
- **Key Contributions**: Formalizes meta-analytic and meta-algorithmic data categories; demonstrates practical bitfield implementation for scientific workflows; proposes community-driven protocol standardization approach.
- **Repository**: [github.com/bitfloat/examples](https://github.com/bitfloat/examples)

## Research Projects

### Earth System Science Applications

**Livestock Density Modeling**

- **Domain**: Agricultural sustainability, land use modeling
- **Bitfield Content**: Statistical distributions (median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis), uncertainty sources, model selection and agreement metrics
- **Innovation**: Preserves full probabilistic information from ensemble models rather than reducing to simple means
- **Repository**: [github.com/bitfloat/examples/project_1.R](https://github.com/bitfloat/examples)

**Ecological Carrying Capacity Assessment**

- **Domain**: Sustainability science, ecological economics
- **Bitfield Content**: Carrying capacity thresholds, exceedance risk probabilities, resource limitation types and magnitudes
- **Innovation**: Enables uncertainty-aware threshold analysis by reconstructing full probability distributions from upstream bitfields
- **Repository**: [github.com/bitfloat/examples/project_2.R](https://github.com/bitfloat/examples)

**Socioeconomic Intervention Planning**

- **Domain**: Policy analysis, sustainable development
- **Bitfield Content**: Market distortion classifications, GDP adjustment estimates, system trajectories, intervention priorities
- **Innovation**: Integrates ecological and economic metadata to identify synergistic intervention opportunities
- **Repository**: [github.com/bitfloat/examples/project_3.R](https://github.com/bitfloat/examples)
