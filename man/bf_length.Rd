\usage{
bf_length(
  x,
  test,
  dec = NULL,
  fill = TRUE,
  pos = NULL,
  na.val = NULL,
  description = NULL,
  registry = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=data.frame]{data.frame(1)}}\cr the table that contains
\code{test}.}

\item{test}{\code{\link[=character]{character(1)}}\cr the column in \code{x} for which
the length is determined.}

\item{dec}{\code{\link[=character]{character(1)}}\cr regex-compatible symbol that
separates the decimals from the numeric value (such as \code{\\.} in case
the decimal symbol is a ".").}

\item{fill}{\code{\link[=logical]{logical(1)}}\cr whether the function should consider
decimals lengths from 0 through the maximum length in \code{x[[test]]}, or
whether it should only document existing decimal lengths.}

\item{pos}{\code{\link[=integer]{integerish(.)}}\cr the position(s) in the bitfield that
should be set.}

\item{na.val}{\code{\link[=character]{character(1)}}\cr optional value that should be
used to substitute NA values in the input data.}

\item{description}{\code{\link[=character]{character(.)}}\cr optional description that
should be used instead of the default function-specific description. This
description is used in the registry legend, so it should have as many
entries as there will be entries per the respective flag in the legend (two
for a binary flag, as many as there are cases for a cases flag and one for
count or numeric flags).}

\item{registry}{\code{\link[=registry]{registry(1)}}\cr a bitfield registry that has
been defined with \code{\link{bf_registry}}; if it's undefined, an empty
registry will be defined on-the-fly.}
}
\value{
an object of class 'registry' with the additional flag defined here.
}

\details{
The console output of various classes shows decimals that are not
present or round decimals away that are present, even for ordinary numeric
vectors. If a bit flag doesn't seem to coincide with the values you see in
the console, double check the values with \code{\link{str}}.

Determine the number of decimals of coordinates to determine their
precision:
