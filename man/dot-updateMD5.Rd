\usage{
.updateMD5(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=registry]{registry(1)}}\cr registry for which to determine the MD5
checksum.}
}
\value{
this function is called for its side-effect of storing the MD5 checksum in the md5 slot of the registry.
}
\description{
Determine and write MD5 sum
}
\details{
This function follows the following algorithm: \itemize{
\item set the current MD5 checksum to NA_character_,
\item write the registry into the temporary directory,
\item calculate the checksum of this file and finally
\item store the checksum  in the md5 slot of the registry.}
This means that when comparing the MD5 checksum in this slot, one first has to set that value also to NULL, otherwise the two values won't coincide.
