Print registry in the console (not working yet)
}
\details{
This method produces an overview of the registry by printing a
header with information about the setup of the bitfield and a table with
one line for each flag in the bitfield. The table shows the start position
of each flag, the encoding type (see \code{\link{.determineEncoding}}), the
bitfield operator type and the columns that are tested by the flag.
